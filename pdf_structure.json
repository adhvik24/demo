The plot\nform may be comic, tragic, romantic or satiric.\nThe central incident is selected to manifest, as\nmuch as possible, the protagonist’s life and\ncharacter, and the details contribute to the\ndevelopment of the plot.\nThe term ‘short story’ covers a great diversity of\nprose fiction, right from the really short ‘short\nstory’ of about five hundred words to longer and\nmore complex works. The longer ones, with their\nstatus of middle length, fall between the tautness\nof the short narrative and the expansiveness of\nthe novel.\nThere can be thematic variation too. The stories\ndeal with fantasy, reality, alienation and the\nproblem of choice in personal life. There are three\nshort stories and two long ones in this section\nrepresenting writers from five cultures.\nReprint 2025-26",

A novelist, short-\nstory writer and journalist, he is widely considered\nthe greatest living Latin American master of narrative.\nMarquez won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982.\nHis two masterpieces are One Hundred Years in\nSolitude (1967, tr. 1970) and Love in The Time of\nCholera (1985, tr. 1988). His themes are violence,\nsolitude and the overwhelming human need for love.\nThis story reflects, like most of his works, a high\nGabriel Garcia Marquez point in Latin American magical realism; it is rich\n1927-2014 and lucid, mixing reality with fantasy.\nOne morning at nine o’clock, while we were having breakfast\non the terrace of the Havana Riviera Hotel under a bright\nsun, a huge wave picked up several cars that were driving\ndown the avenue along the seawall or parked on the\npavement, and embedded one of them in the side of the\nhotel. It was like an explosion of dynamite that sowed panic\non all twenty floors of the building and turned the great\nentrance window to dust. The many tourists in the lobby\nwere thrown into the air along with the furniture, and\nsome were cut by the hailstorm of glass. The wave must\nhave been immense, because it leaped over the wide two-\nway street between the seawall and the hotel and still had\nenough force to shatter the window.\nThe cheerful Cuban volunteers, with the help of the\nfire department, picked up the debris in less than six hours,\nand sealed off the gate to the sea and installed another,\nReprint 2025-26",

During the morning\nnobody worried about the car encrusted in the wall, for\npeople assumed it was one of those that had been parked\non the pavement. But when the crane lifted it out of its\nsetting, the body of a woman was found secured behind\nthe steering wheel by a seat belt. The blow had been so\nbrutal that not a single one of her bones was left whole.\nHer face was destroyed, her boots had been ripped apart,\nand her clothes were in shreds. She wore a gold ring shaped\nlike a serpent, with emerald eyes. The police established\nthat she was the housekeeper for the new Portuguese\nambassador and his wife.

Her name meant nothing to me\nwhen I read it in the newspaper, but I was intrigued by the\nsnake ring and its emerald eyes.

I had met her thirty-four years earlier in Vienna,\neating sausage with boiled potatoes and drinking draft beer\nin a tavern frequented by Latin American students. I had\ncome from Rome that morning, and I still remember my\nimmediate response to her splendid soprano’s bosom, the\nlanguid foxtails on her coat collar, and that Egyptian ring\nin the shape of a serpent. She spoke an elementary Spanish\nin a metallic accent without pausing for breath, and I\nthought she was the only Austrian at the long wooden\ntable. But no, she had been born in Colombia and had\ncome to Austria between the wars, when she was little\nmore than a child, to study music and voice. She was\nabout thirty, and did not carry her years well, for she had\nnever been pretty and had begun to age before her time.\nBut she was a charming human being. And one of the\nmost awe-inspiring.\nVienna was still an old imperial city, whose\ngeographical position between the two irreconcilable worlds\nleft behind by the Second World War had turned it into a\nReprint 2025-26",

She never told her real name, and we\nalways knew her by the Germanic tongue twister that we\nLatin American students in Vienna invented for her: Frau\nFrieda. I had just been introduced to her when I committed\nthe happy impertinence of asking how she had come to be\nin a world so distant and different from the windy cliffs of\nQuindio, and she answered with a devastating:\n‘I sell my dreams.’\nIn reality, that was her only trade. She had been the\nthird of eleven children born to a prosperous shopkeeper\nin old Caldas, and as soon as she learned to speak she\ninstituted the fine custom in her family of telling dreams\nbefore breakfast, the time when their oracular qualities\nare preserved in their purest form. When she was seven\nshe dreamed that one of her brothers was carried off by a\nflood. Her mother, out of sheer religious superstition,\nforbade the boy to swim in the ravine, which was his\nfavourite pastime. But Frau Frieda already had her own\nsystem of prophecy.\n‘What that dream means,’ she said, ‘isn’t that he’s\ngoing to drown, but that he shouldn’t eat sweets.’\nHer interpretation seemed an infamy to a five-year-old\nboy who could not live without his Sunday treats. Their\nmother, convinced of her daughter’s oracular talents,\nenforced the warning with an iron hand. But in her first\ncareless moment the boy choked on a piece of caramel that\nhe was eating in secret, and there was no way to save him.\nFrau Frieda did not think she could earn a living with\nher talent until life caught her by the throat during the\ncruel Viennese winters. Then she looked for work at the\nfirst house where she would have liked to live, and when\nshe was asked what she could do, she told only the truth:\n‘I dream.’ A brief explanation to the lady of the house was\nall she needed, and she was hired at a salary that just\nReprint 2025-26",

They were all\nreligious and therefore inclined to archaic superstitions,\nand they were delighted to take in Frau Frieda, whose\nonly obligation was to decipher the family’s daily fate\nthrough her dreams.\nShe did her job well, and for a long time, above all\nduring the war years, when reality was more sinister than\nnightmares. Only she could decide at breakfast what each\nshould do that day, and how it should be done, until her\npredictions became the sole authority in the house.

The master of the house died\nat about the time I was in Vienna, and had the elegance to\nleave her a part of his estate on the condition that she\ncontinue dreaming for the family until her dreams came\nto an end.\nI stayed in Vienna for more than a month, sharing the\nstraitened circumstances of the other students while I\nwaited for money that never arrived.

It happened on the day Pablo\nNeruda stepped on Spanish soil for the first time since the\nCivil War, on a stopover during a long sea voyage to\nValparaiso. He spent a morning with us hunting big game\nin the second-hand bookstores, and at Porter he bought\nan old, dried-out volume with a torn binding for which he\npaid what would have been his salary for two months at\nthe consulate in Rangoon. He moved through the crowd\nlike an invalid elephant, with a child’s curiosity in the\ninner workings of each thing he saw, for the world appeared\nto him as an immense wind-up toy with which life invented\nitself.\nI have never known anyone closer to the idea one has\nof a Renaissance pope: He was gluttonous and refined.\nEven against his will, he always presided at the table.\nMatilde, his wife, would put a bib around his neck that\nbelonged in a barbershop rather than a dining room, but it\nwas the only way to keep him from taking a bath in sauce.\nThat day at Carvalleiras was typical. He ate three whole\nlobsters, dissecting them with a surgeon’s skill, and at the\nsame time devoured everyone else’s plate with his eyes\nand tasted a little from each with a delight that made the\ndesire to eat contagious: clams from Galicia, mussels from\nCantabria, prawns from Alicante, sea cucumbers from the\nCosta Brava. In the meantime, like the French, he spoke\nof nothing but other culinary delicacies, in particular the\nprehistoric shellfish of Chile, which he carried in his heart.\nAll at once he stopped eating, tuned his lobster’s antennae,\nand said to me in a very quiet voice:\n‘There’s someone behind me who won’t stop looking at\nme.’\nReprint 2025-26",

We invited her to have coffee at our table, and I\nencouraged her to talk about her dreams in order to astound\nthe poet. He paid no attention, for from the very beginning\nhe had announced that he did not believe in prophetic\ndreams.\n‘Only poetry is clairvoyant,’ he said.\nAfter lunch, during the inevitable stroll along the\nRamblas, I lagged behind with Frau Frieda so that we could\nrenew our memories with no other ears listening.
